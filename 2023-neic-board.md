We teach all the **essential tools** which are usually skipped in academic
education so everyone can make full use of **software, computing, and data**.

We don't just give courses, but **we are a training network** that you can join
to share the effort and bring better courses to your community.

# High-level question to the NeIC Board

NeIC can be a career-growth opportunity and a project incubator.
NeIC already has the community and a critical size for this.

How can we get the **local/line management** (who allocates people to budgets
and sets priorities) behind this?  It is the line management that often decides
what staff should focus on.
