## CodeRefinery

We teach tools and practices for the
development of reproducible and reusable research software.


### We wish to provide

- .emph[For organizations]: an opportunity to pool competence and offer more training
  and development opportunities than they could individually.
- .emph[For volunteers and the team]: a community around teaching and opportunity for
  skill development, both in pedagogy and practical skills.
- .emph[For learners]: a welcoming and useful environment for learning many necessary
  practical skills that may otherwise not be explicitly taught. This can be
  through courses, hackathons, and the like.
