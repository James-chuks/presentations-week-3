# GitLab repository hosting for the Nordics


### Service statistics

- 121 users
- 156 projects
- 12 groups


### Notable projects/groups

- [Symbioses](http://akvaplan.niva.no/en/symbioses): simulating ecological impact of an oil spill
- [NorduGrid Advanced Resource Connector](http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/)

# Automated testing use cases


### [Nordugrid ARC](http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/)

*"With GitLab we now not only have a version control system (git), but also a
very good platform for discussing changes to the source-code, performing
automatic build upon commits, and setting up a testing infrastructure. We are
using GitLab extensively now, and plan to expand the automatic deploy and
testing that GitLab offers in the near future." [Maiken Pedersen]*


### [Dalton and LSDalton](http://daltonprogram.org)

*"The Dalton project consists of several feature-rich programs. This is
reflected in the test set which is thus very demanding. Using the CodeRefinery
CI service, we are able to run the test set in a reasonable time, thus
accelerating the development workflow, and additionally it allows us to run the
individual tests in both serial and parallel mode." [Jógvan Magnus Haugaard Olsen]*


### [DIRAC](http://diracprogram.org)

Computes molecular properties using relativistic quantum chemical methods.

# Goals for follow-up project

- Include Estonia and Iceland to our network and activities
- Focus on **workshops** but keep services running
- In workshops **use own services**
- **Reach scale**
  - Training and promoting instructors
  - Good practice guides
  - Screen-casts
- Create hub for **Nordic reseach software engineers** (RSEs)
  - Workshops for instructors and RSEs
  - Organize a Nordic RSE conference
- Reach **sustainability** (more below)

---

# Network

### Aalto Science-IT (Richard Darst)

- Very fruitful collaboration with Richard Darst: lesson development and sharing of material,
  co-organized two CodeRefinery workshops
- Commitment to sponsoring two workshops per year as part of top-to-bottom, yearly training program
- Will spread this model through Finnish Grid and Cloud Infrastructure university partners.

### Nordic RSE

- https://www.pdc.kth.se/about/pdc-news/the-nordic-research-software-engineer-initiative-1.823934

### Possible future Carpentries partnership

- NeIC has granted support for 5 Software Carpentry workshops in the Nordics

---

# How to become sustainable in 3 years

- Grow the number of instructors
- Increase visibility of material
- Encourage re-use and modification of the material
- After phase 2 we will have certified "CodeRefinery instructors" distributed over the Nordics
- NeIC partners will contribute instructors in-kind to teach at ~2 workshops a year
  (great career development, Carpentries model)
- Call for invited workshops: host institutions will cover travel and lodging
- "CodeRefinery hubs": universities willing to host 1-2 workshops per year (good example: Aalto Science-IT)
- Institutions and NeIC partners contribute to 1 FTE for administration and coordination

---

# Conclusion

- There is significant need for workshops that are more advanced than Carpentries
- NeIC and partners have a working team
- Working drop-in model
- Little risk or uncertainty
- Career development opportunity for NeIC/IP staff
