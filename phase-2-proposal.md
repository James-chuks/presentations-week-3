# Automated testing use cases

(list CI use cases)

# Goals for follow-up project

- Focus on **workshops** but keep services running
- In workshops **use own services**
- **Reach scale**
  - Training and promoting instructors
  - Good practice guides
  - Screen-casts
- Create hub for **Nordic reseach software engineers** (RSEs)
  - Workshops for instructors and RSEs
  - Organize a Nordic RSE conference
- Reach **sustainability** (more below)

---

# Network

(Mention Aalto Science-IT)

(Nordic RSE)

(Possible future Carpentries partnership)

# How to become sustainable in 3 years

- Grow the number of instructors
- Increase visibility of material
- Encourage re-use and modification of the material
- After phase 2 we will have certified "CodeRefinery instructors" distributed over the Nordics
- NeIC partners will contribute instructors in-kind to teach at ~2 workshops a year
  (great career development, Carpentries model)
- Call for invited workshops: host institutions will cover travel and lodging
- "CodeRefinery hubs": universities willing to host 1-2 workshops per year (good example: Aalto Science-IT)
- Institutions and NeIC partners contribute to 1 FTE for administration and coordination
- Joint PhD program à la http://www.nordicfivetech.org/joint-projects/phd-collaboration
