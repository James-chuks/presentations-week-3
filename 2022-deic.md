- The importance of .emph[communicating value to organizations]
- .emph[Outreach and marketing] takes time and work
- Learners and volunteers typically join for a short time
- Building long lasting relationships takes effort

# GitLab: "adopt-a-service"

- Code repository hosting for Nordic research software: https://coderefinery.org/repository/

- Over 300 active users, 175 groups, with over 400 active projects

- .emph[Operated by DeiC]

- ~50k DKK/ year: **ca. 15 DKK per active user and month**

- Funding beyond 2024/2025 currently unclear

# Lessons learned/ observations

- From local computing centers towards national (e.g.
  [Sigma2/NRIS](https://www.sigma2.no/)) and international compute resources
  (e.g.
  [EuroHPC](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/)/[LUMI](https://lumi-supercomputer.eu/))

- .emph[Distributed support staff]: Organizations will have to collaborate on training and .emph[stay close to the users]

- .emph[Good enough practices] that are used better than perfect practices not
  applied

- Instead of "good for others": ".emph[good for your future you] and as side
  effect good for others"
