<!--
Sphinx format with all markdown, no slides, multi-collaborator effort, built
around exercises, minimum one larger exercise per lesson, solutions in
dropdown, discussion suggestions, instructor guide, making things citable is
WIP, ...

# What we have learned

## About motivating/teaching

- Teaching isn't a lecture anymore. It's more
  .emph[like a live TV production], which *can* be as interactive as people in
  a room.

- .emph[Co-teaching] is a great way to onboard, get better quality, and reduce
  stress

- .emph[Good enough practices] better than perfect practices not
  applied

- Instead of "good for others": ".emph[good for your future you] and as side
  effect good for others"

---

# What we have learned

## About scaling

- "bring your own classroom" seems to be a way to scale

- .emph[Installation instructions and on-boarding] become more important

- We don't "see" classrooms -> .emph[feedback mechanism] in Q&A doc

- Make exercises longer to .emph[give classrooms the chance to interact]

---

.left-column50[
## Future: Organization

- Communicate value for volunteers and organizations

- Research groups send their students to us instead of
  creating isolated material

- More collaboration with similar projects ("helper exchange program")

- Towards non-profit organization so that we can
  participate in funding applications
]

.right-column50[
## Teaching format

- Continue large-scale workshops

- Support local events

- More asynchronous content coupled with online events
]

- **Join our next workshop** , autumn 2024; follow newsletter to get involved
- Tell your students and researchers about it
- Send one or more **exercise teams** or **join as observer**
- Use our material and give feedback
