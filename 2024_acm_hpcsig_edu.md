# Lessons

We use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)/[sphinx-lesson](https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson) to build our lessons from Markdown.

<!--
Sphinx format with all markdown, no slides, multi-collaborator effort, built
around exercises, minimum one larger exercise per lesson, solutions in
dropdown, discussion suggestions, instructor guide, making things citable is
WIP, ...

## TODO: here I will add a screenshot from the Git lesson

# What we have learned

## About motivating/teaching

- Teaching isn't a lecture anymore. It's more
  .emph[like a live TV production], which *can* be as interactive as people in
  a room.

- .emph[Co-teaching] is a great way to onboard, get better quality, and reduce
  stress

- .emph[Good enough practices] better than perfect practices not
  applied

- Instead of "good for others": ".emph[good for your future you] and as side
  effect good for others"

---

# What we have learned

## About scaling

- "bring your own classroom" seems to be a way to scale

- .emph[Installation instructions and on-boarding] become more important

- We don't "see" classrooms -> .emph[feedback mechanism] in Q&A doc

- Make exercises longer to .emph[give classrooms the chance to interact]

---

# Collaborative document: Markdown

- Interactive, anonymous, parallel, async
- New question every 1-2 minutes!
- ASCII-graph feedback

TODO: update to show Q and A and a poll

<img src="img/collaborative-document/title.png"
     alt="Screenshot of exercise title and links on collaborative document"
     style="width: 100%;" />

We publish Q&A for each workshop: [Example](https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/questions/)

.left-column50[
## Future: Community project

- Communicate value for volunteers and organizations

- Research groups send their students to us instead of
  creating isolated material

- More collaboration with similar projects ("helper exchange program")

- Governance is community-driven
]

.right-column50[
## Teaching format

- Continue large-scale workshops

- Support local events

- More asynchronous content coupled with online events
]
