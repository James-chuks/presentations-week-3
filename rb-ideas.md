# Thoughts about CodeRefinery future

## Radovan Bast [@\_\_radovan](https://twitter.com/__radovan)

# The easy part

- There is demand
- This work makes sense
- However: If we don't do it, who will?

---

# The difficult part

- Connect "supply" and "demand" in an efficient and motivating way
- Bureaucracy
- Top-down sub-sub-contracting


### Requires two things (one is not enough)

- Motivated organization
- Motivated person


### How to motivate

- Motivate organizations to give motivated staff some time to contribute
- Reward their work (CV)
- Reward organizations with training seats and collaboration network
- Short commitments (instead of risky/unreliable years-long service contracts)

---

# Future (these are personal thoughts)

- More invested and more open steering group
- In-kind instead of top-down financed
- Easier to participate short-term
- Clear communication of benefits
- Support synchronous and asynchronous learning
- Mentorship
- Summer/winter schools
- Grow into a center and attract people/projects
- Trademark and organization registration
