## CodeRefinery: strategy statement

CodeRefinery acts as a .emph[hub for FAIR] (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
Reusable) .emph[software practices]. It currently focuses on the Nordic/Baltic
countries, but aims to expand beyond this region. CodeRefinery aims to operate
as a community project with support from academic organizations.


### We wish to provide

- .emph[For organizations]: an opportunity to pool competence and offer more training
  and development opportunities than they could individually.
- .emph[For volunteers and the team]: a community around teaching and opportunity for
  skill development, both in pedagogy and practical skills.
- .emph[For learners]: a welcoming and useful environment for learning many necessary
  practical skills that may otherwise not be explicitly taught. This can be
  through courses, hackathons, and the like.

## Scaling up during 2020: effective team work

<img src="img/scaling-up.png" style="width: 50%;"/>

- Before 2020: ~25 participants, ~2 helpers
- Now: routinely 100+ participants, 20+ helpers
- Lectures & code-along exercises in the main room: .emph[stream and also record]
- Get help and group exercises in a breakout room
- Participants can register as teams (.emph["bring your own breakout room"])
- Installation sessions and helper preparation sessions
- Asynchronous Q&A via [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) ->
  we publish these ([example](https://coderefinery.github.io/2020-10-20-online/#questions-answers-and-feedback))

## FAIR principles have many aspects

- Principles
- Best practices
- Policies
- Standards
- Governance model
- Development of tools
- .emph[Training] (version control, notebooks, documentation, code review, version control for dependencies, licenses, testing)
- .emph[Mentorship]

---

## Future/challenges

- Transitioning to a community project
- Expand beyond the Nordic/Baltic region
- Towards a non-profit organization
- Make it easier for organizations and individuals to join
- Give .emph[better credit] for volunteer contributions
- Offer not only training but also .emph[mentorship network]
- FAIR software practices survey
- How to better advertise and reach and connect the community?
