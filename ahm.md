## CodeRefinery: hub for FAIR software practices

### CodeRefinery provides:

- For organizations: an .emph[opportunity to pool competence] and offer more training and development opportunities than they could individually.

- For volunteers and the team: a .emph[community around teaching] and opportunity for skill development, both in pedagogy and practical skills.

- For learners: a .emph[welcoming and useful environment for learning] many necessary practical skills that may otherwise not be explicitly taught. This can be through courses, hackathons, and the like.

## Collaboration models

1. Idea for a course/event

2. Announce to possible instructors: others join as helpers and give feedback

3. By working together:
  - we share knowledge internally and with learners
  - .emph[develop better and more open materials than we would alone]


### What we need

- A way to quickly share our plans at an early stage
- Have enough spare time (and management support) to join courses that others may be proposing

## Challenge: Governance

- .emph[Clear distinction between NeIC project and community project]

- NeIC role needs to decrease over time if we want sustainability

- Make it possible and attractive for organizations to join also on short term

- Dynamic project leader(s) chosen by the community

- We will need legal support and organizational support in becoming independent
