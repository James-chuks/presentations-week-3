# Future of teaching (notes)

- not everybody needs to be active during a course: make it easy for people to drop by for the parts they are interested in
- need for mentor networks
- co-teaching, co-organizing: lone hero -> two people -> ATC
- teaching together: easier to on-board
- document for communication
- portrait quality screen share
- live-streaming and privacy
- design lessons to learners' needs not to what instructors use
- public-first
- streaming setup image
