# What we have learned

- co-teaching, co-organizing: lone hero -> two people -> ATC
- streaming setup image
- teaching together: easier to on-board
- live-streaming and privacy
- "bring your own team"

.cite[R. Darst "The Future of Teaching" ([text](https://hackmd.io/KRqQirJ_Rn2SHcE-t1iAUg?view), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9Jor12Cxdc))]

### Goals

- Not everybody needs to be active during a course: make it easy for people to
  drop by for the parts they are interested in
- .emph[Good enough practices] that are used better than perfect practices not
  applied
- Instead of "good for others": ".emph[good for your future you] and as side
  effect good for others"


### Lesson design

- Design lessons to learners' needs not to what instructors use
- Public-first


### Tech

- Ask and answer questions using collaborative document
- Dedicate time to set up high-quality screen share
- Portrait screen share, not landscape aspect

---

### Community and coordination

- .emph[Coordination effort] starts to outweigh lesson preparation and teaching
- The importance of .emph[communicating value to organizations]
- .emph[Outreach and marketing] takes time and work
- Volunteer retention and building long lasting relationships takes effort


### Follow-up

- Need for mentor networks


### Funding and reporting

- Measuring participation becomes more difficult

---

(We will summarize which development tools and practices we have found to be
essential and offer recommendations on where to start and how to progress.)
