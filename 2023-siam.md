---

### Lesson design

- Design lessons to learners' needs not to what instructors use
- Public-first


### Tech

- Ask and answer questions using collaborative document
- Dedicate time to set up high-quality screen share
- Portrait screen share, not landscape aspect


### Privacy

- Make it impossible for audience to appear in voice or picture
- We can publish recordings sooner
- Recordings are most viewed on the same day

---

### Community and coordination

- .emph[Coordination effort] starts to outweigh lesson preparation and teaching
- The importance of .emph[communicating value to organizations]
- .emph[Outreach and marketing] takes time and work
- Volunteer retention and building long lasting relationships takes effort


### Follow-up

- Need for mentor networks


### Funding and reporting

- Not everybody needs to be active during a course: make it easy for people to
  drop by for the parts they are interested in
- Measuring participation becomes more difficult

---

## Where to start and how to progress? Code review

     alt="Example of a side-by-side code diff used during code review"
     style="height: 400px;"/>

---

### .emph[Good enough practices] that are used better than perfect practices not applied

- Too many commits better than no commits
- One branch better than no branches


### Instead of "good for others": ".emph[good for your future you] and as side effect good for others"

- Try a [ReproHack](reprohack.org): try to reproduce published work
- Learn how to share work inside your group: "which versions have you used?"
- Talk about licenses


### Mentoring and support

- Code review and feedback
- Code reading sessions
- Office hours

---

# There are other projects in this space

Great overview by the [INTERSECT project](https://intersect-training.org/)
(INnovative Training Enabled by a Research Software Engineering Community of Trainers)

- Collection of RSE training material, workshops, and resources:
  https://intersect-training.org/training-links/


### How can project collaborate across funding borders?

- Cross-advertise
- Link to material
- We would like to encourage our project members to help out at other workshops
  and vice versa
