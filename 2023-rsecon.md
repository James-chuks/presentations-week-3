# Collaboration across funding borders

- current team: in-person contributions to the project + volunteers
- Cross-advertise
- Link to material
- We would like to encourage our project members to help out at other workshops
  and vice versa
- Teach together

# What we have learned

## About motivating/teaching

- .emph[Good enough practices] better than perfect practices not
  applied

- Instead of "good for others": ".emph[good for your future you] and as side
  effect good for others"


## About scaling

- .emph[Installation instructions and on-boarding] become more important

- We don't "see" classrooms -> .emph[feedback mechanism] in Q&A doc

- Make exercises longer to .emph[give classrooms the chance to interact]

---

.left-column50[
## Future: Organization

- Communicate value for volunteers and organizations

- Research groups send their students to us instead of
  creating isolated material

- More collaboration with similar projects ("helper exchange program")

- Towards non-profit organization so that we can
  participate in funding applications
]

.right-column50[
## Teaching format

- Continue large-scale workshops

- Support local events

- More asynchronous content coupled with online events
]
