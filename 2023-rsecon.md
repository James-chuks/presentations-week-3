# Collaboration across funding borders

- current team: in-person contributions to the project + volunteers
- Cross-advertise
- Link to material
- We would like to encourage our project members to help out at other workshops
  and vice versa
- Teach together

# What we have learned 

It takes effort to:

- coordinate a workshop, more than actual lesson preparation and teaching

- reach out and do marketing efficiently

- keep volunteers on and build long lasting relationships

<br>
<br>

- The importance of .emph[communicating value to organizations]

- .emph[Good enough practices] that are used better than perfect practices not
  applied

- Instead of "good for others": ".emph[good for your future you] and as side
  effect good for others"



---


## Future

.left-column70[
- Towards being a non-profit or closer to a legal entity so that we can
  participate in funding applications

- More collaboration with similar projects

- Research groups can send their students and helpers to us instead of
  creating isolated material

- Easier to participate as individual or organization, even short-term

- Offer value for volunteers
