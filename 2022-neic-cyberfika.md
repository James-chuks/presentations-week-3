# Non-profit organization

- This is in the project plan
- But who (person and/or organization) will take it up and carry the fiscal and legal risks?
- Do we have any experience with this within NeIC?
- In UK there exists the legal form ["Community interest
  company"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company): profits
  and assets are used "for the public good"
