# Placeholder for ideas, about [coderefinery.org](https://coderefinery.org/) and what can cause challenges

- Since 2016, now **phase 3 until 2025**
     - What then?
- Over 30 instructors/speakers
     - How to get them onboard every time?
- Over 100 exercise leads
     - How to get people onboard?
- Innovative teaching methods
- Lesson material
     - Needs to be updated
- Video recordings
     - Needs editing

### Lesson design

- Design lessons to .emph[learners' needs] not to what instructors find cool
- Public-first


### Tech

- Ask and answer questions using collaborative document
- Dedicate time to set up high-quality screen share
- Screen share: .emph[portrait mode, not landscape]


### Privacy

- Make it impossible for audience to appear in voice or picture
- We can publish recordings sooner
- Recordings are most viewed on the same day

---

### Community and coordination

- .emph[Coordination effort] starts to outweigh lesson preparation and teaching
- The importance of .emph[communicating value to organizations]
- .emph[Outreach and marketing] takes time and work
- Volunteer retention and building long lasting relationships takes effort


### Follow-up

- Need for mentor networks


### Funding and reporting

- Not everybody needs to be active during a course: make it easy for people to
  drop by for the parts they are interested in
- Need to adapt how we measure participation
