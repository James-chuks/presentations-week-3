## CodeRefinery workshop: Why Reverse hybrid

- **Issue with hybrid:**
     - People onsite ≠ people online.

- **Large courses:**
     - Most students don't have time to ask a question f2f
     - They online chat with the teacher anyway

- **Reverse hybrid:**
     - Teachers via video and online chat
     - Students in onsite groups
     - Those who want interaction can get it
     - The course isn't bound to one location, anyone can attend.

- *It is actually scaling up!*
- **First challenge:** Explain how to join :D

## Scaling up – Technical side

### Scaling up – Technical side

- Many moving parts
     - Screenshare material and terminal / Jupyter
     - Zoom + OBS: audio and video in both (mute, on/off…)
     - Sound levels have to be checked with every speaker
     - Different scenes to screensharing, discussion, breaks…

- New bottlenecks: 
     - What we worry the most: The Q&A document
          - We get up to 40 questions per hour
          - Collaborative document might crash
          - User errors: someone selects all and delete…
          - Needs a few people to moderate
     - More people -> more technical problems -> overhead in solving them

## Scaling up – Arrangements

### Scaling up – Arrangements

- Many things also before and after
     - .emph[Coordination effort] starts to outweigh lesson preparation and teaching
- We removed Zoom teams 
     - Arranging people creates overhead

- Many people:
     - Difficult to get a common understanding
     - Level of teaching: 
          - All participants won't have the same prerequisites
          - Always taking the novices into account leads all courses being basic course
     - Meeting expectations: 
          - Some want walkthrouhgs and some want proper problem-solving exercises
     - How to know how people are doing?
          - We don't see them, only the document

- Certificates: how do we assess what people have been done?
- Volunteer retention and building long lasting relationships takes effort
     - There has been 30 instructors/speakers, Over 100 exercise leads (not in one event)
