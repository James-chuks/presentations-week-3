### Lecturer notes
Why reverse hybrid
- Issue with hybrid:
     - People onsite â‰  people online.
- Large courses: 
     - most students don't have time to ask a question f2f
     - they chat with the teacher anyway
- Reverse hybrid:
     - Teachers via video and chat
     - Students in onsite groups
     - Those who want interaction can get it
     - The course isn't bound to one location, anyone can attend.

# Technical side

- Set up nice screen share
- Sound levels have to be checked
- Collaborative document 
     - might crash or user errors
     - Needs a few people to maintain / oversee
- We removed Zoom teams because a lot of work
     - Some people got less interactivity
- With Zoom teams:
     - drop-offs lead to too small teams or event empty rooms -> rearranging people creates overhead

# Workshop arrangement

     - Level of teaching: with massive courses all participants won't have the same prerequisite level
     - Exercises: some want walkthrouhgs and some want proper problem-solving exercise
     - One large WS vs. multiple smaller ((This could actually be the whole topic ðŸ¤“))
          - Collection of topics vs. concise content
          - a lot of work in a few weeks vs. some work throughout the year
          - reserved almost whole weeks vs. occasional days
          - longer days vs. shorter days
     - Community and coordination
          - .emph[Coordination effort] starts to outweigh lesson preparation and teaching
          - The importance of .emph[communicating value to organizations]
          - .emph[Outreach and marketing] takes time and work
          - Volunteer retention and building long lasting relationships takes effort
          - Over 30 instructors/speakers, Over 100 exercise leads
               - How to get them onboard every time?
