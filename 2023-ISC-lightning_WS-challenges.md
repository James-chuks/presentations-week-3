# Placeholder for ideas, about [coderefinery.org](https://coderefinery.org/) and what can cause challenges

- Since 2016, now **phase 3 until 2025**
     - What then?
- Over 30 instructors/speakers
     - How to get them onboard every time?
- Over 100 exercise leads
     - How to get people onboard?
- Innovative teaching methods
- Lesson material
     - Needs to be updated
- Video recordings
     - Needs editing

- Reporting
     - Need to adapt how we measure participation

- Community and coordination
     - .emph[Coordination effort] starts to outweigh lesson preparation and teaching
     - The importance of .emph[communicating value to organizations]
     - .emph[Outreach and marketing] takes time and work
     - Volunteer retention and building long lasting relationships takes effort

- Tech
     - Dedicate time to set up high-quality screen share
     - RKD's tech setup here
     - Sound: everyone does not have a quailty mic or good connection
          - Sound levels have to be checked
- WS arrangement
     - We removed Zoom teams because a lot of work
          - Some people got less interactivity
     - With Zoom teams:
          - drop-offs lead to too small teams or event empty rooms -> rearranging people creates overhead
     - Collaborative document 
          - might crash or user errors
          - Needs a few people to maintain / oversee
     - Level of teaching: with massive courses all participants won't have the same prerequisite level
     - Exercises: some want walkthrouhgs and some want proper problem-solving exercise
     - One large WS vs. multiple smaller ((This could actually be the whole topic ðŸ¤“))
          - Collection of topics vs. concise content
          - a lot of work in a few weeks vs. some work throughout the year
          - reserved almost whole weeks vs. occasional days
          - longer days vs. shorter days
