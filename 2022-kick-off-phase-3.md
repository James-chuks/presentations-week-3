# History of the project

- The project idea/directive grew out of two courses given at .emph[PDC/KTH in 2014 and 2015].

- The courses were popular and it was clear that the demand is not limited to
  the Stockholm region and we approached NeIC to bring this project to a Nordic
  level, both to have .emph[more impact], but also to .emph[connect instructors across Nordic borders].

- The first CodeRefinery workshop was given late 2016 and since then the lesson
  material has evolved a lot and we have delivered many more workshops, both
  in-person and online.

- In 2018 the project has received follow-up funding from NeIC for 3 more
  years, until 2021. In 2021 .emph[the project successfully applied to the NeIC open call 2021 for another 3 years, starting 2022].

# The long way from idea to change

- .emph[Idea]
- Note it down to not forget it
- Find it again
- Find out who is interested
- Schedule an event/meeting
- Prepare the meeting
- Lead the meeting
- Explain the idea again and again
- Make sure we take notes
- Get any form of commitment before people disconnect for another meeting
- Find the notes later in the document pile
- Make the notes understandable to those who were not there
- Schedule more follow-ups
- Eventually: blog post or pull request or something

## Most ideas never materialize
