# Near-term sustainability

- In-kind model seems to work.
  - Staff take time of their work for the greater good.
  - Open-source licenses are the working tool.
  - Small working percentages a problem for focus.

- This can almost surely continue after the project ends.

- **Coordination** will be a challenge, though.

---

# Longer-term sustainability

- Non-profit association to manage money from diverse sources

- Partners can pay some instead of dedicating own staff

- Fewer staff can dedicate more time

- Also opens up possibility of dedicated training for the general
  public.

- Significant unknowns and risks here.
