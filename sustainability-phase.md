## We can be proud

- We have done really, really cool stuff over the last years, far beyond what
  anyone expected. Others want to do this, we want to help them.
- We have big plans for the future
- We are grateful that this proposal was selected
- The proposed project is big, not small
- The challenge will be to become a .emph[community project]

## CodeRefinery: strategy statement

CodeRefinery acts as a .emph[hub for FAIR] (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
Reusable) .emph[software practices]. It currently focuses on the Nordic/Baltic
countries, but aims to expand beyond this region. CodeRefinery aims to operate
as a community project with support from academic organizations.


### We wish to provide

- .emph[For organizations]: an opportunity to pool competence and offer more training
  and development opportunities than they could individually.
- .emph[For volunteers and the team]: a community around teaching and opportunity for
  skill development, both in pedagogy and practical skills.
- .emph[For learners]: a welcoming and useful environment for learning many necessary
  practical skills that may otherwise not be explicitly taught. This can be
  through courses, hackathons, and the like.

## Activity A: Management and coordination

- Coordination of CodeRefinery and the Carpentries workshops and events
- .emph[Carpentries Regional Coordinator]
- Community building and outreach

---

## Activity B: Operations

- CodeRefinery and Carpentries workshops
- Lesson development and maintenance
- Instructor training and development
- .emph[Operation and support of the GitLab service]

---

## Activity C: Sustainability and governance

- .emph[Establishment of CodeRefinery as an organization]
- .emph[Business model development and implementation]

---

## Proposed CodeRefinery charter for the community project

- The steering group advises the project on strategy issues.  The steering
  group consists of .emph[one representative of each partner and 1-3 community representatives].
- The .emph[project leader(s) are selected from the community] and confirmed by the
  steering group.  The project leaders guide the day-to-day affairs of the
  project team.
- The project team consists of the community who wishes to be more active.
  Membership is confirmed by the project leaders.
- Partners are organizations who are interested in contributing to CodeRefinery
  beyond taking part in individual workshops.  Partners join with confirmation
  by the steering group.

## Important but tricky points

- Make it possible for organizations to join also on short term
- Clear distinction between NeIC project and community project
- Dynamic project leader(s) chosen by the community
- NeIC role needs to decrease over time if we want sustainability
- Asking for 1 FTE and for in-kind contributions was deliberate
- It can only work when both team member(s) and their organization want this
- We will need legal support and organizational support in becoming independent
- Let us solve these challenges together!
