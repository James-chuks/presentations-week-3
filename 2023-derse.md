# What we have learned 

- .emph[Coordination effort] starts to outweigh lesson preparation and teaching

- The importance of .emph[communicating value to organizations]

- .emph[Outreach and marketing] takes time and work

- Learners and volunteers typically join for a short time

- Building long lasting relationships takes effort

- .emph[Good enough practices] that are used better than perfect practices not
  applied

- Instead of "good for others": ".emph[good for your future you] and as side
  effect good for others"
