## CodeRefinery: bridging the gap

### Benefits of the Carpentries membership and coordination

- Provide a progression
- Make CodeRefinery visible to the Carpentries community
- Collaboration on teaching to reach people who are difficult to reach
- Provision of priority seats for instructor training

---

## A vision of reaching many people at once

## Scaling up during 2020: effective team work

<img src="img/scaling-up.png" style="width: 50%;"/>

- Previously: ~25 participants, ~2 helpers
- Now: routinely 100+ participants, 20+ helpers
- Lectures & code-along exercises in the main room: .emph[stream and also record]
- Get help and group exercises in a breakout room
- Participants can register as teams (.emph["bring your own breakout room"])
- Installation sessions and helper preparation sessions
- Asynchronous Q&A via [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) ->
  we publish these ([example](https://coderefinery.github.io/2020-10-20-online/#questions-answers-and-feedback))

## Nordic research software engineers

### First online get-together held last week: .emph[100 registrants]

- https://nordic-rse.org/events/2020-online-get-together/

<img src="img/nordic-rse-meetup.png" style="width: 70%;"/>

### First conference to take place May 27-28, 2021, Stockholm

---

## GitLab service

- Source code repository hosting for .emph[Nordic research software]
- .emph[580 users with projects, 108 groups, 986 projects]
- Notable projects: ARC/NT1, Earth Observation Laboratory, Centre for
  Integrated Remote Sensing and Forecasting for Arctic Operations, Symbioses,
  Nordic Language Processing Laboratory, EISCAT, UiT Master of Applied Computer
  Science, UiT Narvik R&D - Umbrella.
- Maintained by DeiC (very professional maintenance)


### Challenge

- .emph[Long-term funding] (now coupled to CodeRefinery funding)
- .emph[User support] (now CodeRefinery team)

## Value of the network and teamwork: success stories

### Python course

- Instead of each site developing their own course, we combined efforts and
  together developed one within 3 weeks:
  https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/


### Research Software Hour

- Weekly online stream/show about scientific computing and research software
- https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io/


### Instructor training

- 3 instructor training events in one year, co-organized across
  borders

## Recent feedback

> "I take this chance to congratulate once more for the very appreciated workshop.
> I really enjoyed all the sessions, this is something I have been looking for
> for a couple of years now and that I will strongly advertise between my
> colleagues.  In particular, I would like to congratulate you for your
> professionalism and for having made the most of all the potential of distance
> learning, without ever complaining about its obvious and unnecessary
> limitations. The team effort during the classes was impressive. Also, the
> material available to support the classes is excellent and I am sure I will
> exploit it in the future."

# What is CodeRefinery?

## CodeRefinery's biggest development may not be *teaching*...

## ... is it *teaching together*?

---

## Future: our "ask"

.left-column40[
### Can we really co-teach, instead of each partner re-inventing teaching?

<img src="img/pyramid.png" style="width: 120%;"/>
]
.right-column50[
### CodeRefinery can bring and coordinate best practices

- among infrastructure providers and other "hands-on teachers"
- reducing duplicated work
- teaching hybrid online/in person
- teaching best practices in *lesson development*
- teaching *collaboration*
- teaching *how to train others*

This can't be fully bottom-up.

.emph[We ask the NeIC board to help get us there, determine interest, and lobby.]

## CodeRefinery 2022: .emph[Community project]

Primary tasks:

- Classic "CodeRefinery workshops" with focus on best software practices, organized by partners
- Own training: both open tracks and sponsored personalized courses
- Coordinate other shared collaborative training events
- Train the trainer
- .emph[Seeking co-funding from NeIC and participating universities]

Additional goals:

- Continue coordinating Carpentries events in Nordics/Baltic countries
- Driving Nordic research software engineers (RSE) network
- "Training support" of NeIC, for other projects
- Support professional development of RSEs
- Improve towards a more inclusive community and better gender balance
